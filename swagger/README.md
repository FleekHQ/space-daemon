## Space Swagger UI

This directory contains the Swagger UI for the generated REST APIs.
Ideally, you should not have to manually touch anything in this directory.
Anything that needs to be updated should be automatically generated by running the command
`make gen_proxy_swagger` from the base directory of this repo.

### Directory Structure

1. **ui**: This contains the swagger ui /dist files. You should not edit this file. The `make gen_proxy_swagger` command
would automatically update the space.swagger.json on generation.
2. **bin_ui**: This is automatically generated by `gen_proxy_swagger` and is a statik binary representation of the 
ui/ directory. This is the package that is used to statically serve swagger ui along with the daemon.

### Swagger UI

The swagger UI is automatically served when the space binary (aka daemon) is run.
It can be access from the REST proxy port at the path `/swaggerui/`. By default the url should be at
http://localhost:9997/swaggerui/.
